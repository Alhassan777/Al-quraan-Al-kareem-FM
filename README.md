# Quran Kareem Radio from Cairo — Online Platform

Welcome to the **Quran Kareem Radio** project! This online platform streams the live broadcast of **إذاعة القرآن الكريم من القاهرة**, the oldest and most iconic radio station in Africa and the Middle East. This station holds a special place in the identity and childhood of every Egyptian and Arabic-speaking person. Unfortunately, the radio station lacked the technical expertise to create an online streaming platform. Seeing this gap, I took the initiative to build one.

The platform allows users to listen to live broadcasts, view and personalize the daily program schedule based on their timezone, and search through a comprehensive database of all reciters in the station’s history. It also offers features for manually or automatically recording favorite programs, along with friendly pop-up reminders to encourage Islamic habits. Designed with both functionality and engagement in mind, this platform serves as a one-stop solution for staying connected to the rich tradition of Quranic broadcasting.

## What I Learned

This project was an incredible learning experience that taught me how to build and connect a solid data pipeline to solve real-world problems. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **Data Automation and Cleaning**  
   - Used the **Telegram Telethon API** to automate the retrieval of raw schedule data from an unofficial channel managed by a station employee.  
   - Cleaned and structured the messy, inconsistent raw data using the **Gemini API**, testing prompts to generate a JSON table for daily updates.

2. **Real-Time Functionality**  
   - Integrated **WebSockets** to ensure instant schedule updates reflected on the platform without requiring page reloads.

3. **Overcoming CORS Issues**  
   - Built a **Node.js server** to handle live stream recording and data serving seamlessly, addressing challenges with cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).

4. **Product Design Mindset**  
   - Shifted my focus from just writing code to thinking like a product manager.  
   - Conducted user testing, gathered feedback, and adapted features to create a meaningful user experience.  

This project wasn’t just about technical skills; it was about merging development with user-centered design to make something impactful and engaging.
